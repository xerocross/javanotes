java notes:
  - data structures:
      - queue:
          - "A queue interface is first in, first out"
          - "The canonical functions for interacting with a queue":
              - "offer"
              - "peek"
              - "poll"
      - stack:
          - "The canonical functions for interacting with a stack":
              - "push"
              - "pop"
              - "peek"

  - nested classes:
      - inner classes:
          - "inner classes cannot have static declarations"
  - strings see StringsTests:
      - "the _intern_ method on a string looks in the string pool and returns an equal string there";
      - "The _concat_ method on a String object concatenates the string with its argument string."
  - streams:
      - "streams are in java.util.stream"
      - "IntStream.generate accepts a supplier lambda";
      - IntStream:
          - "An IntStream cannot accept filter with a Predicate<Integer>. You have to use IntPredicate."
          - "To map the stream from int to long, you have to use the _mapToLong_ method on the stream. The _map_ method is not robust like for the Stream object."
      - map:
          - "The map function for Stream is robust enough to handle converting one object to another, unlike primitive streams. FunctionalsTests"
  - lambdas:
      - "when specifying the type in a lambda expression, parentheses around the argument are obligatory"
      - "If you use variables from the closure in a lambda expression, they must be final or effectively final. See FunctionalsTests":
          - "Why?":
              - "One source cites possible concurrency problems as the reason."
  - abstract classes:
      - "you can define an instance of an abstract class using an anonymous class in place. See MySpecializedAbstractClassTest"
  - functionals:
      - build-it functionals:
          - "the built-in functionals are in java.util.function"
          - Consumer:
              - "you can define a raw instance of the parameterized class Consumer, and then you can pass an int into it, but the int gets autoboxed. See see AutoBoxingAndLambdaTest.java"
              - "consumer's method to apply the functional is _accept_"
          - Predicate:
          - IntPredicate:
          - IntConsumer:
          - Supplier:
              - "The function of a Supplier for getting a value from it is _get_."
          - IntSupplier:
              - "It's noteworthy that Java requires these specialized functionals for primitive types. see FunctionalsTests"
  - autoboxing/unboxing:
      - "primitives get autoboxed when passed into Consumer<X> functionals. See see AutoBoxingAndLambdaTest.java"
