# Java Notes

This is a self-direct student project wherein I write sample Java classes 
that illustrate code and perform little experiments.
I also plan to write notes about Java and include them in a simple 
java_notes.yml file. The classes and test classes here are not intended
to form any kind of program. Rather, they are intended to be read by 
human eyes and executed one-by-one for the user to see the results.

I may add other kinds of notes, like essays written
in markdown or other groupings of notes in other formats.

This is not a textbook, and there is no implied guarantee of accuracy.
However, I'm doing this for my own learning, so I will try to make
my notes accurate. I invite pull requests from anyone who wants
to correct any mistake I made.

## Notes and Essays

[Java Notes Yaml](java_notes.yml)

[Nested Classes](nestedClasses.md)

[Object Oriented Programming](OOP.md)

## java version

I will be working in Java 11 unless new features in a new version 
come out and they are so compelling I simply must study them, at which
point I may upgrade.
