# Java Notes

This is a self-direct student project wherein I plan to 
write sample Java classes that illustrate code and test its limits.
I also plan to write notes about Java and include them in a simple 
java_notes.yml file.

I may add other informative kinds of information, like essays written
in markdown or other groupings of notes in other formats.
