# Java Notes

This is a self-direct student project wherein I plan to 
write sample Java classes that illustrate code and test its limits.
I also plan to write notes about Java and include them in a simple 
java_notes.yml file.

I may add other informative kinds of information, like essays written
in markdown or other groupings of notes in other formats.

This is not a textbook, and there is no implied guarantee of accuracy.
However, I'm doing this for my own learning, so I will try to make
my notes accurate. I invite pull requests from anyone who wants
to correct any mistake I made.

## java version

I will be working in Java 11 unless new features in a new version 
come out and they are so compelling I simply must study them, at which
point I may upgrade.
